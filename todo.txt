Possible TODO's:

1: Exceptions in title there will be many I assume (MORE EXIST THAT WILL NEED A LOOK IN THE FUTURE)
    - dots, dashes, and signs, commas, html codes the
    - these exceptions will also be in the artists we will probably have to irate over them and remove dots / dashes etc.

2: Check if itune artists can have brackets can have (souer souire - dominique has it but idk if it matters)

3: Make song player that can work with only ids, ideally that works with links from multiple countries (nl & us at the very least)

4: make a database in which the previews can be ajusted (could even be an API (we'll see))

5: Without making the game look nice make it somewhat possible to simulate an actual game to help with debugging

6: For this the pre made functions will have to be connected

7: ofcourse the entire game needs to be designed but i dont see this as a priority (ended up being prioritized :clown:

8: Can I put the js scripts in separate files and how?

10: Eventually might even make a chatroom?

11: Locate & fix error in aftergame mean time.

12: ABBREVIATIONS

13: Cleanup of code + add commentss

14: findout why mean time updates one step later in profile
