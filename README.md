### Songguesser game

This is a selfmade songguessing game/website where the user has to guess a certain song from a 30 second preview. 
It is based of other games such as binb.co (and other sites no longer in use :( ).
It was made using pythons framework Flask with some needed javascript for the interactivity! 
The previews are all handpicked from iTunes, Spotify or Deezer API by me based of how easy I think the song is to recognize!
